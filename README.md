Since I studied my technical degree in Digital Systems IÂ´ve been in love with microprocessors. Back then in 2019, I first heard about the Risc-V revolution. In order to get involved with this open ISA I attended a symposium organized by SiFive and the Lagarto Project team (https://www.proyectos.cic.ipn.mx/index.php/lagarto). After that, the Lagarto Project team's leader invited me to the initiative, so they taught me about modern microarchitectures, Register Transfer Level techniques for hardware descriptions and so on. 

Here you can find the work I developed in my first 4 months with Lagarto. I invite you to take a look at M1-Guelon and P1-Thon. The former is a single-cycle microprocessor and the latter a pipelined microprocessor. Both of them are capable of executing the majority of Integer instructions of the open ISA RISC-V instruction set architecture.
